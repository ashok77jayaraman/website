## Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide for implementing a basic DevOps lifecycle using Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible. The objective is to automate the build, test, and deployment process of a web application hosted on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- A set of target machines where the software will be installed (can be local or remote).
- Jenkins server installed and accessible.
- Docker installed on target machines.
- Ansible installed on the machine where Ansible commands will be executed.
- A forked repository of the web application to be deployed ([Example Repository](https://github.com/hshar/website.git)).
- GitHub account with administrative access to the forked repository.

## Step 1: Install Necessary Software using Ansible

1. Create an Ansible playbook (e.g., `install.yml`) to install necessary software on target machines.

    ```yaml
    # install.yml
    ---
    - name: Install necessary software
      hosts: all
      become: true
      tasks:
        - name: Install Git
          apt:
            name: git
            state: present

        - name: Install Docker
          apt:
            name: docker.io
            state: present
    ```

2. Run the Ansible playbook.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i install.yml
    ```

## Step 2: Implement Git Workflow

1. Fork the repository `https://github.com/hshar/website.git` into your organization.
2. Create branches as needed (e.g., `master`, `develop`, feature branches).
3. Configure Git hooks or use webhooks in your repository to trigger Jenkins jobs on commits.

## Step 3: Jenkins Pipeline

1. Create a Jenkins pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

    ```groovy
    // Jenkinsfile
    pipeline {
        agent any

        stages {
            stage('Build') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        git 'https://github.com/your-username/website.git'
                        sh 'docker build -t your-docker-image .'
                    }
                }
            }

            stage('Test') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        sh 'docker run your-docker-image npm test'
                    }
                }
            }

            stage('Prod') {
                when {
                    branch 'master'
                }
                steps {
                    script {
                        sh 'docker push your-docker-image'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. Configure Jenkins jobs (`Job1`, `Job2`, `Job3`) based on the Jenkins pipeline script.

## Step 4: Dockerfile

1. Create a Dockerfile for your application.

    ```dockerfile
    # Dockerfile
    FROM hshar/webapp
    COPY . /var/www/html
    ```

## Step 5: Jenkins Job Configuration

1. Create three Jenkins jobs:
    - Job1: Build
      - SCM: Git
      - Build Trigger: Poll SCM or GitHub webhook
      - Execute Shell: Use the Jenkins pipeline script
    - Job2: Test
      - Same configuration as Job1, but modify the pipeline script accordingly.
    - Job3: Prod
      - Same configuration as Job1, but modify the pipeline script accordingly.

## Step 6: GitHub Webhook

1. Configure a GitHub webhook to trigger Jenkins jobs on commits. Configure this in your GitHub repository settings.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a basic framework for implementing a DevOps lifecycle using Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible. Customize and extend these steps based on your organization's specific requirements, security considerations, and best practices.
